I found that I have an active link to the home page when on the home page and so I removed that. Additionally, I went through and removed the active links for the currently active pages.
I feel that it actually helps the user to better know what page they are on without having to explore the rest of the page because it also results in highlighting the current page that 
a user is on.

Also, I included a header on each page and made sure that it matched the link that was used to select the page.

Another bit of improvement that I noticed was the size of the header and navbar which made it a bit more difficult to always have all of the information above the fold for each page
because of how the size of certain images of artwork differ from piece to piece.

Lastly, I felt that the colors used in the background of the gradient for the headers was too dark and hard on the eyes, so I lightened the main gradient color.

These are what I found with my website that relate to the contents of Chapter 16: Users, Usability, and Web Design.
