            <p class="art-p">This piece is a digital image created in Adobe Illustrator.
                This was my Design 2 final project. It is inspired by
                the Magic the Gathering plainswalker: Serra. It includes the symbol for the
                mana type associated with Serra. Additionally, there are forget me nots with
                the intended meaning of rememberance.

            <img class="art-img" src="../images/Elisabeth Jewett ART110 F24 Final Project.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="art-p">This piece was created in Adobe Illustrator and was my Design I final project.
                It was inspired by Jack Kirby, the comic book artist.
                It includes comics where he was the artist, a standing easel that he worked
                on, with a portrait of Jack Kirby on the easel. It also includes a drafting
                table setup basaed on one of Kirby's own setups. Featured front and center
                is the man featured on the Inkpot Awards, which Jack Kirby recieved in 1977.
