            <p id="kir-p">This piece was created in Adobe Illustrator and was my Design I final project.
                It was inspired by Jack Kirby, the comic book artist.
                It includes comics where he was the artist, a standing easel that he worked
                on, with a portrait of Jack Kirby on the easel. It also includes a drafting
                table setup basaed on one of Kirby's own setups. Featured front and center
                is the man featured on the Inkpot Awards, which Jack Kirby recieved in 1977.
